# Automated Computer Science Grader

This code is used to automate the grading process for python scripts. Code written by Charlie Rothschild (Email: [c_rothschild@coloradocollege.edu](mailto:c_rothschild@coloradocollege.edu)). Last updated on 01/23/2025.

## Directions

Add a folder of all assignments to the project folder, then run run_cst_inputs.py

```bash
$ python run_cst_inputs.py
```
Then enter required inputs into terminal. When writing simulated user input, type \n to simulate the enter key being pressed
## Sample Usage

```bash
$ python run_cst_inputs.py
Write directory path here: sample_assignments
Write code names here (code1,code2,code3): overlap,race,windchill
Type command for overlap (\n to simulate enter key, q to quit): cp115,cp116,cp122,cp222\ncp116,cp222,cp274
Type command for overlap (\n to simulate enter key, q to quit): cp115,cp116,cp122,cp222\ncc100,cc120,ma126
Type command for overlap (\n to simulate enter key, q to quit): q
Type command for race (\n to simulate enter key, q to quit): 20,20\n15,30\n25,25
Type command for race (\n to simulate enter key, q to quit): 0.73,0.11\n1.333,2.98\n0,0
Type command for race (\n to simulate enter key, q to quit): q
Type command for windchill (\n to simulate enter key, q to quit): 27.1\n8.0
Type command for windchill (\n to simulate enter key, q to quit): q
        
```
